    "From a good unit test, we want a test that is focused, isolated, and reproducible. It shouldn't collide with other tests over shared state/data issues or fail due to changes in schema (that would be more of an integration or end-to-end test). This means we won't be using a real remote database for our unit test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define our input data and expected output data using Python collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for the table dependencies -- like the `orders` table in our example -- we need to seed it with just enough data to verify the behavior of the SQL code under test. We'll use a lightweight trick. Rather than create and seed a real table in the DB  -- this is a valid option too -- we will create a common table expression (CTE), `orders`, where we generate SELECT statements with the values from our Python input data."
